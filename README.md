# Real_Estate_REST_Calculator
Java Web application using my own REST API (Web services)

I created a real estate calculator that takes different factors into consideration such as interest rate, <br/>
amortization period, purchase price, downpayment, and targeted potential profit.<br/>

Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some JS.<br/>

Back-end: Maven project with REST architecture and Java Jersey.<br/>
<br/>
This app was deployed locally using a Payara glassfish server 6 (6.2.3)<br/>
